# Galiley - Band Website 
Galiley is a cover band for hire. They play on everything from weddings
to private parties or school events. This website is ment to showcase what
service the band offers and give potential customers more information. Galiley is
a real band that I used to play in, but we are not playing at the moment. Therefore 
this website is half-fiction, so not everything on it is correct.

## UX
#### User Stories

* As a band for hire who are looking for more gigs to play we want to showcase our
  services. Introduce us to potential cusomers, show what we play and what events, 
  pricing, where we are playing and how to contact us. 
* As a customer i want to find if the band fits for my event, if they are within my
  budget and how to hire them. 
* As a fan i like to see upcoming gigs and their whereabouts, videos and music, and links
  to social media. 


Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, 
focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want 
to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them 
achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features 
Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

The home page features 3 sections. One "About Us" section which introduces the band,
one "What We Offer" where we describe what service we can offer for different events, and 
one review section which is made up reviews, but look nice. 


The media page features two sections. One "Setlist" section which feautures different setlists for different events, and where you 
also can listen to the songs. The other section is "Video", where you can find some youtube videos from the band. 

The schedule page shows upcoming gigs with their whereabouts, date and some additional information.

The pricing page has some packages listing what you get for what price. Also information of how we price our services,
and encurage the user to contact the band to get a deal.

The contact page is a form where you can contact the band with a request.

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

* About Us - Allows the user to get to know more about the people and the band they would be hiring. 
* What We Offer - Allows the user to read about what kind of service we provide, and see if it fits with their event. 
* Reviews - Let's the potential customer read other peoples reviews and get an insight to what it would be to hire the band.
* Setlist Sample - Allows the user to both see the songs, but also listen to sample setlists the band could play on their event. 
* Video - Let's the user see and hear what the band can provide. 
* Schedule - Allows the fans to find the next gig they would like to attend. In addition to letting users who are looking to hire 
  get a sence if the band is availible or not. 
* Our Pricing - Allows the user to read more about how we price our events, and also what info to bring when contacting the band to
  get a deal of their own. 
* Pricing Packages - Let's the user get a feel of what different events cost and what is included in them. 
* Contact - Let's the user contact the band with a request.
* Follow Us - Let's the user find our social media pages and find more news there. 

#### Features left to implement

* The contact form doesn't work as it is, which needs to be fixed in the future. 
* Would like more videos from the band, displaying different types of events. As is at the moment the 
  two videos displayed are from a music competition and is not the most relevant of content, but okey for now. 

#### Another Feature Idea 
 Would like to let the user pick out a package of their own and make their own custom setlist 
 to that package of their choice.

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
